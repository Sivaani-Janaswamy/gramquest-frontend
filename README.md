## Quick Setup Guide

This repository contains the frontend client for **Gramquest â€“ Your Social Knowledge Hub**. It's built with React JS and Tailwind CSS, providing the user interface and interacting with the Gramquest Backend API.

### Technologies Used

* React JS
* Tailwind CSS
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* React Router (for navigation)
* Axios (for API calls)

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have these installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/gramquest-frontend.git](https://github.com/your-username/gramquest-frontend.git)
    cd gramquest-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Backend Server:**
    Ensure the [Gramquest Backend](https://github.com/your-username/gramquest-backend) is running. This frontend expects the backend to be accessible, typically at `http://localhost:5000`. You might need to configure a proxy in `package.json` or set `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in a `.env` file if your backend is not on `localhost:5000`.

### Running the Frontend

To start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
````

The application will typically open in your browser at `${import.meta.env.VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL}`.
